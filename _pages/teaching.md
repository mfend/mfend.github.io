#### Teaching Philosophy
I believe in student-centered curricula that are thoughtfully designed for specific, measurable learning outcomes. 
There is a wealth of research about how students best learn, and I believe that it's our duty as teachers to take 
advantage of that literature, to best serve our students. Central to this philosophy are concepts of empathy and fostering
a positive, equitable, fun learning environment. To this end, I believe in:

* Practices of Equitable Teaching
* Growth Mindset
* Active Learning
* Backward Design

#### Experience
I have been the TA for 12.000: Terrascope for the last 2 years. This course is focused on experience-based learning and community
building for MIT first years. This class has offered me the opportunity to reflect on non-traditional ways of learning, as well 
as to spend quality time with MIT undergrads.

For the 2021-2022 academic year I will serve as the EAPS Teaching Development Fellow. In this role I will organize workshops
and communities in the department to develop thoughtful teaching practices among graduate students and faculty.

#### Certifications
Through the MIT Teaching and Learning lab (certificate available upon request):
* Subject Design
* Teaching Practice
