I'm a 5th year PhD candidate in the MIT-WHOI Joint Program. I use computing and proxy system modeling to study climate and the way signals of climate change are recorded in the geologic record. I have a broad interest in paleoclimate and proxies, but for the most part I'm interested in icebergs, paleolakes, and abrupt climate change.
