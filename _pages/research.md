### Icebergs, How They Carry Sediment
This project uses the iceberg module of MITgcm to model sediment transport during Heinrich Events. We investigate how the partitioning of sediment in icebergs, as well as the impact of factors like iceberg size, can impact the extent and thickness of Heinrich Layers. (work with Alan Condron)

### Machine Learning and Tufa Textures
I used computer vision to classify the variability of textures of lacustrine tufa in Searles Valley, CA and compare them to those at Mono Lake, CA, with the goal of tying preserved tufa texture to a lake environment. (work with David McGee)

### Paleolake Shoreline Feature Modeling
For this upcoming work, we will model spits in Bonneville Basin with the goal of constraining the duration of lake level occupancies during the Last Glacial Period. (work with David McGee and Andrew Ashton)
